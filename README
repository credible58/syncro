Syncro: Program access to plugin_if via TCP This plugin allows the loose coupling
of a process to Wireshark. The coupling is achieved through a TCP connection from
the process to Wireshark. This can be a local TCP connection (via the localhost 
interface) or a remote connection. A default parameter setting restricts the 
connection to one made via localhost. Syncro provides a small TCP server running
on a separate thread within Wireshark. This server accepts TCP connections from
one or more external processes (programs). Once the connection is made, Syncro
accepts commands (GotoFrame and ApplyFilter) from the client process, sends
responses to the commands and generates events for asynchronous actions such as
moving within the trace file.
